### 1. Leaked Native Factory Handles

**Files:**
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/SoftwareVideoDecoderFactory.java`
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/SoftwareVideoEncoderFactory.java`

**Problem:**
Both of these classes create a native factory object in their constructors and store the handle in a `long nativeFactory` field. However, neither class provides a `release()` or `dispose()` method to free the allocated native resource. This results in a memory leak every time an instance of these factories is created and discarded.

**Suggestion:**
Implement a `release()` method in both classes to clean up the native resources.

**Example for `SoftwareVideoEncoderFactory.java`:**

```java
public class SoftwareVideoEncoderFactory implements VideoEncoderFactory {
    private final long nativeFactory = nativeCreateFactory();

    // ... existing methods ...

    public void release() {
        if (nativeFactory != 0) {
            nativeReleaseFactory(nativeFactory);
            // nativeFactory = 0; // Not possible since it's final, but good practice if it weren't.
                                // The object should not be used after release.
        }
    }

    private static native long nativeCreateFactory();
    private static native void nativeReleaseFactory(long nativeFactory); // Add this native method
    // ... other native methods ...
}
```
You would need to add the corresponding `nativeReleaseFactory` function to the JNI layer to delete the C++ factory object. The same pattern should be applied to `SoftwareVideoDecoderFactory`.

### 2. Leaked Native Histogram Objects

**File:**
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/Histogram.java`

**Problem:**
The `Histogram` class is a wrapper for a native object, identified by a `long handle`. The static factory methods `createCounts` and `createEnumeration` call native methods that allocate these objects. However, there is no corresponding `release()` or `dispose()` method in the `Histogram` class to free the native memory.

In `Camera1Session.java`, these histograms are created as `static final` fields, meaning they are leaked when the application class loader is unloaded, which is a minor issue. However, if `Histogram` objects were created dynamically, this would be a more severe leak.

**Suggestion:**
Add a `release()` method to the `Histogram` class to free the native object.

```java
class Histogram {
   private long handle;

   // ... existing methods ...

   public void release() {
      if (handle != 0) {
         nativeRelease(handle);
         handle = 0;
      }
   }

   private static native void nativeRelease(long handle); // Add this native method
   // ... other native methods ...
}
```

### 3. Leaked `ScheduledExecutorService` in Audio Module

**Files:**
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/audio/JavaAudioDeviceModule.java`
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/audio/WebRtcAudioRecord.java`

**Problem:**
The `JavaAudioDeviceModule.Builder` creates a `WebRtcAudioRecord` instance. If a `ScheduledExecutorService` is not provided to the builder, it creates a default one using `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool()`. This executor is then held by the `WebRtcAudioRecord` instance.

The `JavaAudioDeviceModule`'s `release()` method only frees its own native pointer. It does not release its `audioInput` (`WebRtcAudioRecord`) or `audioOutput` (`WebRtcAudioTrack`) members. `WebRtcAudioRecord` itself lacks a `release()` method to shut down the executor it holds. Consequently, the `ScheduledExecutorService` and its thread are never terminated, causing a leak of the executor, its thread, the `WebRtcAudioRecord` object, and any captured context.

**Suggestion:**
1.  Add a `release()` method to `WebRtcAudioRecord` to shut down its executor.
2.  Update `JavaAudioDeviceModule.release()` to call `release()` on its `audioInput` member.

**Example for `WebRtcAudioRecord.java`:**

```java
class WebRtcAudioRecord {
    // ...
    private final ScheduledExecutorService executor;
    // ...

    public void release() {
        Logging.d(TAG, "release");
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Example for `JavaAudioDeviceModule.java`:**

```java
public class JavaAudioDeviceModule implements AudioDeviceModule {
    // ...
    public final WebRtcAudioRecord audioInput;
    public final WebRtcAudioTrack audioOutput;
    // ...

    public void release() {
        synchronized(this.nativeLock) {
            if (this.nativeAudioDeviceModule != 0L) {
                JniCommon.nativeReleaseRef(this.nativeAudioDeviceModule);
                this.nativeAudioDeviceModule = 0L;
            }
        }
        // Release owned Java resources
        audioInput.release();
    }
}
```

### 4. Potential Listener Leak in `RenderSynchronizer`

**File:**
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/RenderSynchronizer.java`

**Problem:**
The `RenderSynchronizer` starts posting a repeating frame callback to the `Choreographer` when the first listener is added. The loop only stops when the last listener is removed. The class does not have an explicit `release()` or `destroy()` method. If a consumer registers a listener but is destroyed without unregistering it, `RenderSynchronizer` will keep the listener in its list, preventing it from being garbage collected. This also causes the `Choreographer` callback to continue running indefinitely.

**Suggestion:**
Add a `release()` method to `RenderSynchronizer` that explicitly removes the `Choreographer` callback and clears all listeners. This makes resource cleanup more deterministic.

```java
public final class RenderSynchronizer {
    // ... existing fields ...

    public void release() {
        synchronized(lock) {
            if (this.isListening) {
                this.isListening = false;
                this.mainThreadHandler.post(() -> {
                    choreographer.removeFrameCallback(this::onDisplayRefreshCycleBegin);
                });
            }
            listeners.clear();
        }
        Logging.d(TAG, "Released");
    }

    // ... existing methods ...
}
```

### 5. Potential Native Observer Leak in `FrameCryptor`

**File:**
*   `android/src/main/java/org/webrtc/FrameCryptor.java`

**Problem:**
The `setObserver` method calls `nativeSetObserver`, which likely allocates a native peer for the Java observer object and returns its handle. However, the Java code ignores this return value. While it does release the *previous* `observerPtr`, it fails to store the new one. If `setObserver` is called multiple times, this could lead to leaked native observer objects. The line `long newPtr = this.observerPtr;` appears to be dead code, suggesting an incomplete implementation.

**Suggestion:**
Refactor `setObserver` to correctly manage the lifecycle of the native observer peer, similar to the pattern used in `RtpReceiver.java`. The `nativeSetObserver` method should return the handle to the new native observer, which should be stored.

```java
public class FrameCryptor {
    // ...
    private long observerPtr;

    public void setObserver(@Nullable FrameCryptor.Observer observer) {
        this.checkFrameCryptorExists();
        // First, release the old observer peer if it exists.
        if (this.observerPtr != 0L) {
            nativeUnSetObserver(this.nativeFrameCryptor); // Assuming this tells native to stop using the old observer.
            JniCommon.nativeReleaseRef(this.observerPtr);
            this.observerPtr = 0L;
        }
        // Then, set the new one and store its native peer handle.
        if (observer != null) {
            this.observerPtr = nativeSetObserver(this.nativeFrameCryptor, observer);
        }
    }

    // In dispose(), ensure the observerPtr is also released.
    public void dispose() {
      this.checkFrameCryptorExists();
      nativeUnSetObserver(this.nativeFrameCryptor);
      JniCommon.nativeReleaseRef(this.nativeFrameCryptor);
      this.nativeFrameCryptor = 0L;
      if (this.observerPtr != 0L) {
         JniCommon.nativeReleaseRef(this.observerPtr);
         this.observerPtr = 0L;
      }
    }

    // The native method signature might look like this:
    private static native long nativeSetObserver(long frameCryptorPointer, FrameCryptor.Observer observer);
}
```

By addressing these issues, you can improve the robustness and memory efficiency of the application.
